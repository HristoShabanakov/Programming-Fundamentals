# Programming-Fundamentals

The **“Programming Fundamentals”** course extends the previously gained basic coding skills from the **“Programming Basics”** course at the Software University and adds additional **knowledge** and **practical programming skills**. The course covers understanding the basic **data types** in programming, extracting pieces of code into **methods with parameters and return value**, using **the debugger** to trace the program execution and find bugs, processing sequences of elements using **arrays and lists**, using collections, working with matrices for processing tabular data, working with **dictionaries** to map keys to values, using **strings** for text processing, and the basics of working with **classes and objects**, using API classes and defining simple classes. Along with the programming techniques, the **algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills** are advanced by solving hundreds of practical programming problems. All exercises and exams are automatically evaluated with real-time feedback through the SoftUni online judge system. At the end all students take a practical programming exam.
